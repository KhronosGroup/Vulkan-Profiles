## Overview

The Vulkan Profiles library is a helper library that provides the following set of convenience APIs to developers:

* Capability introspection APIs to query the extensions, features, properties, and formats required by a particular Vulkan profile.
* APIs to verify instance-level and device-level support for a particular Vulkan profile or a set of capabilities blocks of a Vulkan Profile.
* Instance and device creation APIs that automatically enable the extensions and features required by selected Vulkan Profiles and selected specific Vulkan Profiles capabilities blocks. Enabling a Vulkan Profile can be thought as explicitly elevating the minimum Vulkan capabilities requirements for the user system.

## Building

The Vulkan Profiles library is provided as a generated header-only C++ library (`vulkan/vulkan_profiles.hpp`) that is bundled with the Vulkan SDK. C++ applications thus can simply use the Vulkan Profiles library by including this header-only C++ library.

The library is primarily designed to be dynamically linked to the Vulkan implementation (loader or ICD). If applications want to dynamically load Vulkan then they have to make sure (one way or another) that the Vulkan API symbols seen by the Vulkan Profiles header-only library are valid and correspond to the dynamically loaded entry points.

In order to enable support for other language bindings, the library is also available in a header + source pair (`vulkan/vulkan_profiles.h` and `vulkan_profiles.cpp`). There is no build configuration for this variant of the library as it's not meant to be used as a standalone static or dynamic library. Instead, developers can drop the files into their own project to build the Vulkan profiles library into it. This may also come handy if the developer would like to optimize compilation times by not having to include the rather large header-only library in multiple source files.

The profile definitions are enabled depending on the pre-processor definitions coming from the Vulkan headers; thus the application has to make sure to configure the right set of pre-processor definitions. As an example, the `VP_ANDROID_baseline_2021` profile depends on the `VK_KHR_android_surface` instance extension; thus in order to use this profile the application must define `VK_USE_PLATFORM_ANDROID_KHR`.

### Generating the library with a custom set of Vulkan Profiles

For many use cases, existing Vulkan Profiles are not very useful, a Vulkan application may require to create it's own Vulkan Profiles to better represent the ecosystem devices the Vulkan application is designed to run on and the rendering code paths.

For this purpose, the Vulkan SDK ships with the `gen_profiles_solution.py` python script in the `share/vulkan/registry` directory. To use this script, simply copy your Vulkan Profiles in a `profiles` directory and use the command:

```
    python gen_profiles_solution.py --registry ./vk.xml --input ./profiles --output-library-inc . --output-library-src .
```

For more information about the Vulkan Profiles library generation, use the command:

```
    python gen_profiles_solution.py --help
```

## Basic usage

The typically expected usage of the Vulkan Profiles library is for applications to target a specific profile with their application and leave it to the Vulkan Profiles library to enable any necessary extensions and features required by that profile.

In order to do so, the application first has to make sure that the Vulkan implementation supports the selected profile as follows:

```C++
    VkResult result = VK_SUCCESS;
    VkBool32 supported = VK_FALSE;
    VpProfileProperties profile{
        VP_KHR_ROADMAP_2022_NAME,
        VP_KHR_ROADMAP_2022_SPEC_VERSION
    };

    result = vpGetInstanceProfileSupport(nullptr, &profile, &supported);
    if (result != VK_SUCCESS) {
        // something went wrong
        ...
    }
    else if (supported != VK_TRUE) {
        // profile is not supported at the instance level
        ...
    }
```

The above code example verifies the instance-level profile requirements of the `VP_KHR_roadmap_2022` profile, including required API version and instance extensions.

If the profile is supported by the Vulkan implementation at the instance level, then a Vulkan instance can be created with the instance extensions required by the profile as follows:

```C++
    VkApplicationInfo vkAppInfo{ VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_APPLICATION_INFO };
    // Set API version to the minimum API version required by the profile
    vkAppInfo.apiVersion = VP_KHR_ROADMAP_2022_MIN_API_VERSION;
    VkInstanceCreateInfo vkCreateInfo{ VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_INSTANCE_CREATE_INFO };
    vkCreateInfo.pApplicationInfo = &vkAppInfo;
    // set up your own instance creation parameters, except instance extensions
    // as those will come from the profile
    ...

    VpInstanceCreateInfo vpCreateInfo{};
    vpCreateInfo.pCreateInfo = &vkCreateInfo;
    vpCreateInfo.enabledFullProfileCount = 1;
    vpCreateInfo.pEnabledFullProfiles = &profile;

    VkInstance instance = VK_NULL_HANDLE;
    result = vpCreateInstance(&vpCreateInfo, nullptr, &instance);
    if (result != VK_SUCCESS) {
        // something went wrong
        ...
    }
```

The above code example will create a Vulkan instance with the API version and instance extensions required by the profile (unless the application overrides any of them, as explained later).

Make sure to set the `apiVersion` in the `VkApplicationInfo` structure at least to the minimum API version required by the profile, as seen above, to ensure the correct Vulkan API version is used.

Once a Vulkan instance is created, the application can check whether individual physical devices support the selected profile as follows:

```C++
    result = vpGetPhysicalDeviceProfileSupport(instance, physicalDevice,
                                               &profile, &supported);
    if (result != VK_SUCCESS) {
        // something went wrong
        ...
    }
    else if (supported != VK_TRUE) {
        // profile is not supported at the device level
        ...
    }
```

Finally, once a physical device supporting the profile is selected, a Vulkan device can be created with the device extensions and features required by the profile as follows:

```C++
    VkDeviceCreateInfo vkCreateInfo{ VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DEVICE_CREATE_INFO };
    // set up your own device creation parameters, except device extensions
    // and device features as those will come from the profile
    ...

    VpDeviceCreateInfo vpCreateInfo{};
    vpCreateInfo.pCreateInfo = &vkCreateInfo;
    vpCreateInfo.enabledFullProfileCount = 1;
    vpCreateInfo.pEnabledFullProfiles = &profile;

    VkDevice device = VK_NULL_HANDLE;
    result = vpCreateDevice(physicalDevice, &vpCreateInfo, nullptr, &device);
    if (result != VK_SUCCESS) {
        // something went wrong
        ...
    }
```

## Advanced usages

### Specifying the API version

By default, it's expected that the application either does not provide its own `VkApplicationInfo` when calling `vpCreateInstance` or it sets its `apiVersion` to the minimum API version required by the profile as defined by the corresponding `<VP_VENDOR_NAME>_MIN_API_VERSION` preprocessor definition.

If the application would like to use a different API version, then it should use its own `apiVersion` in `VkApplicationInfo` at instance creation time instead (e.g. to request a newer API version).

Using an older version than the one required by the profile may result in unexpected behavior if any of the features required by the profile are not present in the specified version of the Vulkan API.

### Specifying additional extensions

If the application would like to specify additional extensions besides the ones defined by the profile, the Vulkan application developers can continue using the `enabledExtensionCount` and `ppEnabledExtensionNames`:

```C++
    VkInstanceCreateInfo vkCreateInfo{ VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_INSTANCE_CREATE_INFO };
    ...
    // Specify additional extensions to use beyond the profile-defined ones
    vkCreateInfo.enabledExtensionCount = ...
    vkCreateInfo.ppEnabledExtensionNames = ...

    VpInstanceCreateInfo vpCreateInfo{};
    vpCreateInfo.pCreateInfo = &vkCreateInfo;
    vpCreateInfo.enabledFullProfileCount = 1;
    vpCreateInfo.pEnabledFullProfiles = &profile;
    ...
```

### Specifying additional features

By default, profile-defined feature structures must not be specified as part of the `pNext` chain of `VkDeviceCreateInfo` when using `vpCreateDevice`, as the profile-defined feature structures are automatically added to the `pNext` chain, and duplicate feature structures would otherwise result in undefined behavior.

If the application needs to specify additional features, the feature structures must be specified as part of the `pNext` chain of `VkDeviceCreateInfo` and the additional enabled features will be merged to the required profile features:

```C++
    // We want to use our own VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan11Features structure,
    // merging any feature enablement in that structure as defined by
    // the profile
    VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan11Features overriddenVulkan11Features{ VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_VULKAN_1_1_FEATURES };
    ...

    VkDeviceCreateInfo vkCreateInfo{ VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DEVICE_CREATE_INFO };
    // Include overridden features in the pNext chain of VkDeviceCreateInfo
    vkCreateInfo.pNext = &overriddenVulkan11Features;
    ...

    VpDeviceCreateInfo vpCreateInfo{};
    vpCreateInfo.pCreateInfo = &vkCreateInfo;
    vpCreateInfo.enabledFullProfileCount = 1;
    vpCreateInfo.pEnabledFullProfiles = &profile;
    ...
```

### Disabling robust access

Many profiles require robust buffer and/or image access; however, applications often prefer to opt out from these features for performance reasons. This can be requested by overriding individual features as explained in the previous section; however, as it's quite a common usage pattern, explicit device creation flags are provided to make it easier to do so.

If the `VP_DEVICE_CREATE_DISABLE_ROBUST_BUFFER_ACCESS_BIT` flag is specified, then the `robustBufferAccess` feature (defined by `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures`) and the `robustBufferAccess2` feature (defined by `VkPhysicalDeviceRobustness2FeaturesEXT`) are disabled, unless the application provides its own overridden feature structures containing the features.

If the `VP_DEVICE_CREATE_DISABLE_ROBUST_IMAGE_ACCESS_BIT` flag is specified, then the `robustImageAccess` feature (defined by `VkPhysicalDeviceImageRobustnessFeatures` and `VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan13Features`) and the `robustImageAccess2` feature (defined by `VkPhysicalDeviceRobustness2FeaturesEXT`) are disabled, unless the application provides its own overridden feature structures containing the features.

Using `VP_DEVICE_CREATE_DISABLE_ROBUST_ACCESS_BIT` disables both buffer and image robustness features.

## API reference

### Preprocessor definitions

Each profile defines the following set of preprocessor definitions:

* `<VP_VENDOR_name>` - Defined to `1` in the presence of the profile
* `<VP_VENDOR_NAME>_NAME` - The character string name of the profile
* `<VP_VENDOR_NAME>_SPEC_VERSION` - The version of the profile definition
* `<VP_VENDOR_NAME>_MIN_API_VERSION` - The minimum Vulkan API version required by the profile

Where:
* `<VP_VENDOR_name>` is the name of the profile
* `<VP_VENDOR_NAME>` is the upper-case name of the profile

### Profile support and usage

The Vulkan Profile library offers a set of APIs to verify support for a particular Vulkan profile and to create Vulkan instances and devices using the extensions and features required by the profile.

#### Checking instance level support

In order to query whether the Vulkan implementation supports the necessary instance level requirements (API version and instance extensions) of a particular profile, use the following command:

```C++
VkResult vpGetInstanceProfileSupport(
    const char*                     pLayerName,
    const VpProfileProperties*      pProfile,
    VkBool32*                       pSupported);
```

Where:
* `pLayerName` is either `NULL` or a pointer to a null-terminated UTF-8 string naming the layer to retrieve extensions from (analogous to the corresponding parameter of `vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties`).
* `pProfile` is a pointer to the `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the profile to check support for.
* `pSupported` is a pointer to a `VkBool32`, which is set to `VK_TRUE` to indicate support, and `VK_FALSE` otherwise.

The `VpProfileProperties` structure is defined as follows:

```C++
typedef struct VpProfileProperties {
    char                            profileName[VP_MAX_PROFILE_NAME_SIZE];
    uint32_t                        specVersion;
} VpProfileProperties;
```

Where:
* `profileName` is the name of the profile
* `specVersion` is the version of the profile specification

#### Creating instance with profile

The Vulkan Profiles library provides the following helper function that enables easier adoption of profiles by automatically including profile requirements in the Vulkan instance creation process:

```C++
VkResult vpCreateInstance(
    const VpInstanceCreateInfo*     pCreateInfo,
    const VkAllocationCallbacks*    pAllocator,
    VkInstance*                     pInstance);
```

Where:
* `pCreateInfo` is a pointer to the `VpInstanceCreateInfo` structure specifying the instance creation info, as described below.
* `pAllocator` controls host memory allocation and is analogous to the corresponding parameter of `vkCreateInstance`.
* `pInstance` points to a `VkInstance` handle in which the resulting instance is returned.

The `VpInstanceCreateInfo` structure is defined as follows:

```C++
typedef struct VpInstanceCreateInfo {
    const VkInstanceCreateInfo*     pCreateInfo;
    VpInstanceCreateFlags           flags;
    uint32_t                        enabledFullProfileCount;
    const VpProfileProperties*      pEnabledFullProfiles;
    uint32_t                        enabledProfileBlockCount;
    const VpBlockProperties*        pEnabledProfileBlocks;
} VpInstanceCreateInfo;
```

Where:
* `pCreateInfo` is a pointer to the `VkInstanceCreateInfo` structure specifying the usual Vulkan instance creation info.
* `flags` is reserved for future use.
* `enabledFullProfileCount` an integer related to the number of profiles to enable listed in `pEnabledFullProfiles`.
* `pEnabledFullProfiles` is a pointer to an array of `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the profiles to enable. If not profiles is enabled, the value is nullptr.
* `enabledProfileBlockCount` an integer related to the number of profile capabilities blocks to enable listed in `pEnabledProfileBlocks`.
* `pEnabledProfileBlocks` is a pointer to an array of `VpBlockProperties` structure specifying the profiles capabilities blocks to enable. If not capabilities block is enabled, the value is nullptr.

The behavior of `vpCreateInstance` is to enable all extensions and features listed by the profiles, the capabilities blocks and in the `pNext` chain of `VkInstanceCreateInfo`.

If the application-provided `VkInstanceCreateInfo` does not specify a `VkApplicationInfo` structure then a `VkApplicationInfo` with an `apiVersion` field equaling the minimum required API version of the profile will be added. If the application does provide a `VkApplicationInfo` it has to make sure that its `apiVersion` field is greater than or equal to the minimum required API version of the profile (e.g. by using the corresponding preprocessor definition).

#### Checking device level support

In order to query whether a Vulkan physical device supports the necessary device level requirements (API version, device extensions, device features and properties/limits) of a particular profile, use the following command:

```C++
VkResult vpGetPhysicalDeviceProfileSupport(
    VkInstance                      instance,
    VkPhysicalDevice                physicalDevice,
    const VpProfileProperties*      pProfile,
    VkBool32*                       pSupported);
```

Where:
* `instance` is the Vulkan instance.
* `physicalDevice` is the physical device to check support on.
* `pProfile` is a pointer to the `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the profile to check support for.
* `pSupported` is a pointer to a `VkBool32`, which is set to `VK_TRUE` to indicate support, and `VK_FALSE` otherwise.

When a profile supports multiple variants, it might be useful to know what capabilities blocks where used to verify the profile or what capabilities blocks are not supported when the profile is not verified on the platform. This is done using the following command:

```C++
VkResult vpGetPhysicalDeviceProfileVariantsSupport(
    VkInstance                      instance,
    VkPhysicalDevice                physicalDevice,
    const VpProfileProperties*      pProfile,
    VkBool32*                       pSupported,
    uint32_t*                       pPropertyCount,
    VpBlockProperties*              pProperties);
```

Where:
* `instance` is the Vulkan instance.
* `physicalDevice` is the physical device to check support on.
* `pProfile` is a pointer to the `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the profile to check support for.
* `pSupported` is a pointer to a `VkBool32`, which is set to `VK_TRUE` to indicate support, and `VK_FALSE` otherwise.
* `pPropertyCount` is a pointer to an integer related to the number of `VpBlockProperties`. If `pSupported` is set to `VK_TRUE`, then the value 
* `pProperties` is a pointer to an array of `VpBlockProperties` structures. If `pSupported` is set to `VK_TRUE`, then the array of blocks contains the blocks used to validate the profile. It `pSupported` is set to `VK_FALSE`, then the array contains the blocks not supported on the platform.

#### Creating device with profile

The Vulkan Profiles library provides the following helper function that enables easier adoption of profiles by automatically including profile requirements in the Vulkan device creation process:

```C++
VkResult vpCreateDevice(
    VkPhysicalDevice                physicalDevice,
    const VpDeviceCreateInfo*       pCreateInfo,
    const VkAllocationCallbacks*    pAllocator,
    VkDevice*                       pDevice);
```

Where:
* `physicalDevice` is the physical device to create the logical device for.
* `pCreateInfo` is a pointer to the `VpDeviceCreateInfo` structure specifying the device creation info, as described below.
* `pAllocator` controls host memory allocation and is analogous to the corresponding parameter of `vkCreateDevice`.
* `pDevice` points to a `VkDevice` handle in which the resulting device is returned.

The `VpDeviceCreateInfo` structure is defined as follows:

```C++
typedef struct VpDeviceCreateInfo {
    const VkDeviceCreateInfo*   pCreateInfo;
    VpDeviceCreateFlags         flags;
    uint32_t                    enabledFullProfileCount;
    const VpProfileProperties*  pEnabledFullProfiles;
    uint32_t                    enabledProfileBlockCount;
    const VpBlockProperties*    pEnabledProfileBlocks;
} VpDeviceCreateInfo;
```

Where:
* `pCreateInfo` is a pointer to the `VkDeviceCreateInfo` structure specifying the usual Vulkan device creation info.
* `flags` is a bitmask of `VpDeviceCreateFlagBits` indicating the behavior of the instance.
* `enabledFullProfileCount` an integer related to the number of profiles to enable listed in `pEnabledFullProfiles`.
* `pEnabledFullProfiles` is a pointer to an array of `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the profiles to enable. If not profiles is enabled, the value is nullptr.
* `enabledProfileBlockCount` an integer related to the number of profile capabilities blocks to enable listed in `pEnabledProfileBlocks`.
* `pEnabledProfileBlocks` is a pointer to an array of `VpBlockProperties` structure specifying the profiles capabilities blocks to enable. If not capabilities block is enabled, the value is nullptr.

The `VpDeviceCreateFlagBits` enumeration is defined as follows:

```C++
typedef enum VpDeviceCreateFlagBits {
    VP_DEVICE_CREATE_DISABLE_ROBUST_BUFFER_ACCESS_BIT = 0x0000001,
    VP_DEVICE_CREATE_DISABLE_ROBUST_IMAGE_ACCESS_BIT = 0x0000002,
    VP_DEVICE_CREATE_DISABLE_ROBUST_ACCESS = VP_DEVICE_CREATE_DISABLE_ROBUST_BUFFER_ACCESS_BIT | VP_DEVICE_CREATE_DISABLE_ROBUST_IMAGE_ACCESS_BIT,

    VP_DEVICE_CREATE_FLAG_BITS_MAX_ENUM = 0x7FFFFFFF
} VpDeviceCreateFlagBits;
typedef VkFlags VpDeviceCreateFlags;
```

The behavior of `vpCreateDevice` is to enable all extensions and features listed by the profiles, the capabilities blocks and in the `pNext` chain of `VkDeviceCreateInfo`.

If the application specifies the `VP_DEVICE_CREATE_DISABLE_ROBUST_BUFFER_ACCESS_BIT`, then the implement will disable buffer robustness.

If the application specifies the `VP_DEVICE_CREATE_DISABLE_ROBUST_IMAGE_ACCESS_BIT`, then the implement will disable image robustness.

If the application specifies the `VP_DEVICE_CREATE_DISABLE_ROBUST_ACCESS`, then the implement will disable all robustness features.

### Profile queries

The Vulkan Profile library offers a set of APIs to query the capabilities defined in a particular Vulkan profile, and may be used both for development-time checking of profile capabilities and for facilitating the construction of custom extension and feature configurations that use only a subset of the capabilities required by the profile.

#### Query profiles

In order to query the list of available profiles, use the following command:

```C++
VkResult vpGetProfiles(
    uint32_t*                       pPropertyCount,
    VpProfileProperties*            pProperties);
```

Where:
* `pPropertyCount` is a pointer to an integer related to the number of profiles available or queried, as described below.
* `pProperties` is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of `VpProfileProperties` structures.

If `pProperties` is `NULL`, then the number of profiles available is returned in `pPropertyCount`. Otherwise, `pPropertyCount` must point to a variable set by the user to the number of elements in the `pProperties` array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of structures actually written to `pProperties`. If `pPropertyCount` is less than the number of profiles available, at most `pPropertyCount` structures will be written, and `VK_INCOMPLETE` will be returned instead of `VK_SUCCESS`, to indicate that not all the available properties were returned.

#### Query profile required profiles

Some profiles require other profiles. In order to query the list of required profiles for a given profile, use the following command:

```C++
VkResult vpGetProfileRequiredProfiles(
    const VpProfileProperties*      pProfile,
    uint32_t*                       pPropertyCount,
    VpProfileProperties*            pProperties);
```

Where:
* `pProfile` is a pointer to the `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the profile whose required profiles are queried.
* `pPropertyCount` is a pointer to an integer related to the number of required profiles available or queried, as described below.
* `pProperties` is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of `VpProfileProperties` structures.

If `pProperties` is `NULL`, then the number of required profiles available for the specified profile is returned in `pPropertyCount`. Otherwise, `pPropertyCount` must point to a variable set by the user to the number of elements in the `pProperties` array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of structures actually written to `pProperties`. If `pPropertyCount` is less than the number of required profiles available for the specified profile, at most `pPropertyCount` structures will be written, and `VK_INCOMPLETE` will be returned instead of `VK_SUCCESS`, to indicate that not all the available properties were returned.

#### Query profile with multiple variants

There are two types of profiles: monolithic profiles which represents a single set of capabilities and profiles with multiple variants which can be supported using differents set of Vulkan capabilities.

In order to query whether a Vulkan profile has multiple variants, use the following command:

```C++
VkResult vpHasMultipleVariantsProfile(
    const VpProfileProperties *pProfile,
    VkBool32 *pHasMultipleVariants);
```

Where:
* `pProfile` is a pointer to the `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the profile whose property is queried.
* `pHasMultipleVariants` is a pointer to a `VkBook32` indicating whether the profiles has multiple variants.

#### Query profile Vulkan API version

A profile requires a specific Vulkan API version. The minimum valid Vulkan API version of a profile, is the version of the Vulkan Header in which all the Vulkan capabilities specified in the profile were defined. However, a Vulkan Profile may require a newer Vulkan API version to explicitly not support Vulkan drivers considered too old, for example.

In order to query the required Vulkan API version for a given profile, use the following command:

```C++
uint32_t vpGetProfileAPIVersion(
    const VpProfileProperties*      pProfile);
```

Where:
* `pProfile` is a pointer to the `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the profile whose required Vulkan API version is queried.

If a profile requires other profiles, `vpGetProfileAPIVersion` will look for the required Vulkan API version of each profile and return the newest Vulkan API version among all the profiles.

#### Query profile fallbacks

Some profiles have recommended fallback profiles, i.e. profiles to use as a fallback in case the original profile is not supported. In order to query the list of fallback profiles for a given profile, use the following command:

```C++
VkResult vpGetProfileFallbacks(
    const VpProfileProperties*      pProfile,
    uint32_t*                       pPropertyCount,
    VpProfileProperties*            pProperties);
```

Where:
* `pProfile` is a pointer to the `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the profile whose fallback profiles are queried.
* `pPropertyCount` is a pointer to an integer related to the number of fallback profiles available or queried, as described below.
* `pProperties` is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of `VpProfileProperties` structures.

If `pProperties` is `NULL`, then the number of fallback profiles available for the specified profile is returned in `pPropertyCount`. Otherwise, `pPropertyCount` must point to a variable set by the user to the number of elements in the `pProperties` array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of structures actually written to `pProperties`. If `pPropertyCount` is less than the number of fallback profiles available for the specified profile, at most `pPropertyCount` structures will be written, and `VK_INCOMPLETE` will be returned instead of `VK_SUCCESS`, to indicate that not all the available properties were returned.

#### Query profile instance extensions

In order to query the list of instance extensions required by a profile, use the following command:

```C++
VkResult vpGetProfileInstanceExtensionProperties(
    const VpProfileProperties*      pProfile,
    uint32_t*                       pPropertyCount,
    VkExtensionProperties*          pProperties);
```

Where:
* `pProfile` is a pointer to the `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the queried profile.
* `pPropertyCount` is a pointer to an integer related to the number of instance extensions available or queried, as described below.
* `pProperties` is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of `VkExtensionProperties` structures.

If `pProperties` is `NULL`, then the number of instance extensions required by the profile is returned in `pPropertyCount`. Otherwise, `pPropertyCount` must point to a variable set by the user to the number of elements in the `pProperties` array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of structures actually written to `pProperties`. If `pPropertyCount` is less than the number of instance extensions required by the profile, at most `pPropertyCount` structures will be written, and `VK_INCOMPLETE` will be returned instead of `VK_SUCCESS`, to indicate that not all the available properties were returned.

#### Query profile device extensions

In order to query the list of device extensions required by a profile, use the following command:

```C++
VkResult vpGetProfileDeviceExtensionProperties(
    const VpProfileProperties*      pProfile,
    uint32_t*                       pPropertyCount,
    VkExtensionProperties*          pProperties);
```

Where:
* `pProfile` is a pointer to the `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the queried profile.
* `pPropertyCount` is a pointer to an integer related to the number of device extensions available or queried, as described below.
* `pProperties` is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of `VkExtensionProperties` structures.

If `pProperties` is `NULL`, then the number of device extensions required by the profile is returned in `pPropertyCount`. Otherwise, `pPropertyCount` must point to a variable set by the user to the number of elements in the `pProperties` array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of structures actually written to `pProperties`. If `pPropertyCount` is less than the number of device extensions required by the profile, at most `pPropertyCount` structures will be written, and `VK_INCOMPLETE` will be returned instead of `VK_SUCCESS`, to indicate that not all the available properties were returned.

#### Query profile features

In order to query the structure types of the Vulkan device feature structures for which the profile defines requirements, use the following command:

```C++
VkResult vpGetProfileFeatureStructureTypes(
    const VpProfileProperties*      pProfile,
    uint32_t*                       pStructureTypeCount,
    VkStructureType*                pStructureTypes);
```

Where:
* `pProfile` is a pointer to the `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the queried profile.
* `pStructureTypeCount` is a pointer to an integer related to the number of device feature structure types available or queried, as described below.
* `pStructureTypes` is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of `VkStructureType` values.

If `pStructureTypes` is `NULL`, then the number of device feature structure types defined by the profile is returned in `pStructureTypeCount`. Otherwise, `pStructureTypeCount` must point to a variable set by the user to the number of elements in the `pStructureTypes` array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of values actually written to `pStructureTypes`. If `pStructureTypeCount` is less than the number of device feature structure types defined by the profile, at most `pStructureTypeCount` values will be written, and `VK_INCOMPLETE` will be returned instead of `VK_SUCCESS`, to indicate that not all the available values were returned.

In order to query the device features required by a profile, use the following command:

```C++
void vpGetProfileFeatures(
    const VpProfileProperties*      pProfile,
    void*                           pNext);
```

Where:
* `pProfile` is a pointer to the `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the queried profile.
* `pNext` is a `pNext` chain of Vulkan device feature structures (with or without a `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2` feature structure).

If the `pNext` chain contains a Vulkan device feature structure for which the profile defines corresponding feature requirements, then the structure is modified to include those features. Other fields of the Vulkan device feature structure not defined by the profile will be left unmodified, and structures not defined in the profile will be ignored (left unmodified as a whole).

#### Query profile device properties

In order to query the structure types of the Vulkan device property structures for which the profile defines requirements, use the following command:

```C++
VkResult vpGetProfilePropertyStructureTypes(
    const VpProfileProperties*      pProfile,
    uint32_t*                       pStructureTypeCount,
    VkStructureType*                pStructureTypes);
```

Where:
* `pProfile` is a pointer to the `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the queried profile.
* `pStructureTypeCount` is a pointer to an integer related to the number of device property structure types available or queried, as described below.
* `pStructureTypes` is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of `VkStructureType` enums.

If `pStructureTypes` is `NULL`, then the number of device property structure types defined by the profile is returned in `pStructureTypeCount`. Otherwise, `pStructureTypeCount` must point to a variable set by the user to the number of elements in the `pStructureTypes` array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of values actually written to `pStructureTypes`. If `pStructureTypeCount` is less than the number of device property structure types defined by the profile, at most `pStructureTypeCount` values will be written, and `VK_INCOMPLETE` will be returned instead of `VK_SUCCESS`, to indicate that not all the available values were returned.

In order to query the device properties required by a profile, use the following command:

```C++
void vpGetProfileProperties(
    const VpProfileProperties*      pProfile,
    void*                           pNext);
```

Where:
* `pProfile` is a pointer to the `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the queried profile.
* `pNext` is a `pNext` chain of Vulkan device property structures (with or without a `VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2` property structure).

If the `pNext` chain contains a Vulkan device property structure for which the profile defines corresponding property/limit requirements then the structure is modified to include those properties/limits. Other fields of the Vulkan device property structure not defined by the profile will be left unmodified and structures not defined in the profile will be ignored (left unmodified as a whole).

#### Query profile format properties

In order to query the structure types of the Vulkan format property structures for which the profile defines requirements, use the following command:

```C++
VkResult vpGetProfileFormatStructureTypes(
    const VpProfileProperties*      pProfile,
    uint32_t*                       pStructureTypeCount,
    VkStructureType*                pStructureTypes);
```

Where:
* `pProfile` is a pointer to the `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the queried profile.
* `pStructureTypeCount` is a pointer to an integer related to the number of format property structure types available or queried, as described below.
* `pStructureTypes` is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of `VkStructureType` enums.

If `pStructureTypes` is `NULL`, then the number of format property structure types defined by the profile is returned in `pStructureTypeCount`. Otherwise, `pStructureTypeCount` must point to a variable set by the user to the number of elements in the `pStructureTypes` array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of values actually written to `pStructureTypes`. If `pStructureTypeCount` is less than the number of format property structure types defined by the profile, at most `pStructureTypeCount` values will be written, and `VK_INCOMPLETE` will be returned instead of `VK_SUCCESS`, to indicate that not all the available values were returned.

In order to query the list of formats required by a profile, use the following command:

```C++
VkResult vpGetProfileFormats(
    const VpProfileProperties*      pProfile,
    uint32_t*                       pFormatCount,
    VkFormat*                       pFormats);
```

Where:
* `pProfile` is a pointer to the `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the queried profile.
* `pFormatCount` is a pointer to an integer related to the number of formats available or queried, as described below.
* `pFormats` is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of `VkFormat` values.

If `pFormats` is `NULL`, then the number of formats required by the profile is returned in `pFormatCount`. Otherwise, `pFormatCount` must point to a variable set by the user to the number of elements in the `pFormats` array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of values actually written to `pProperties`. If `pPropertyCount` is less than the number of device extensions required by the profile, at most `pPropertyCount` values will be written, and `VK_INCOMPLETE` will be returned instead of `VK_SUCCESS`, to indicate that not all the available values were returned.

In order to query the format properties required by a profile for a specific format, use the following command:

```C++
void vpGetProfileFormatProperties(
    const VpProfileProperties*      pProfile,
    VkFormat                        format,
    void*                           pNext);
```

Where:
* `pProfile` is a pointer to the `VpProfileProperties` structure specifying the queried profile.
* `format` is the format for which required properties are queried.
* `pNext` is a `pNext` chain of Vulkan device property structures (with or without `VkPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties2` or `VkPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties3` property structures).

If the `pNext` chain contains a Vulkan format property structure for which the profile defines corresponding requirements then the structure is modified to include those properties. Other fields of the Vulkan format property structure not defined by the profile will be left unmodified and structures not defined in the profile will be ignored (left unmodified as a whole).
